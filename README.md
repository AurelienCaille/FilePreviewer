# FilePreviewer

THIS IS NOT WORKING AND PROBABLY NOT FOR A MOMENT,
as godot dosnt support some live import (like .fbx), we cant fast load and preview this kind of file...
So i'm waiting for new version...

Projet made with GODOT
Currently very first step, not usuable/usefull

Goal is to have a "file explorer" focus on previewing files (mostly images, 3D files like FBX) used in game development
A collection system with tag to have multiple preview will be added
